Welcome to our repository for our project detailing Anomaly Detection in Forwards FX Curves.

Each algorithm's file should be documented with the necessary information to run them individually. Here we shall outline any key points about the project as a whole.

For example, it should be noted that only dataset 2 has labelled anomalies, and we therefore should only use this for testing.
